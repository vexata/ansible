minor_changes:
- Refactored the CLI code to parse the CLI arguments and then save them into
  a non-mutatable global singleton.  This should make it easier to modify.
- Removed the private ``_options`` attribute of ``CallbackBase``.  See the porting
  guide if you need access to the command line arguments in a callback plugin.
