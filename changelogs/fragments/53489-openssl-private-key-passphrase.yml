bugfixes:
- "openssl_privatekey - no longer hang or crash when passphrase does not match or was
   not specified, but key is protected with one. Also regenerate key if passphrase is
   specified but existing key has no passphrase."
- "openssl_csr, openssl_certificate, openssl_publickey - properly validate private key
   passphrase; if it doesn't match, fail (and not crash or ignore)."
