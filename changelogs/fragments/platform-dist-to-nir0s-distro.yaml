minor_changes:
- Python-3.8 removes platform.dist() from the standard library. To maintain
  compatibility we've switched to an alternative library, nir0s/distro, to
  detect the distribution for fact gathering.  Distributions facts may change
  slightly as nir0s/distro has bugfixes which the standard library's
  platform.dist() has lacked.
