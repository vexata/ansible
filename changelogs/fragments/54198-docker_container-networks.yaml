minor_changes:
- "docker_container - a new option ``networks_cli_compatible`` with default value ``no`` has been added. The default value
   will change to ``yes`` in Ansible 2.12. Setting it to ``yes`` lets the module behave similar to ``docker create --network``
   when at least one network is specified, i.e. the default network is not automatically attached to the container in this
   case."
