bugfixes:
- "user - fixed the fallback mechanism for creating a user home directory when
  the directory isn't created with `useradd` command. Home directory will now
  have a correct mode and it won't be created in a rare situation when a local
  user is being deleted but it exists on a central user system
  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/49262)."
