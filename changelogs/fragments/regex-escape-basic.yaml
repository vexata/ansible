    regex_escape - added re_type option to enable escaping POSIX BRE chars

    This distinction is necessary because escaping non-special chars such as
    '(' or '{' turns them into special chars, the opposite of what is intended
    by using regex_escape on strings being passed as a Basic Regular
    Expression.
