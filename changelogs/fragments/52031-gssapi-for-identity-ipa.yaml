minor_changes:
- identity - Added support for GSSAPI authentication for the FreeIPA modules.
  This is enabled by either using the KRB5CCNAME or the KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME
  environment variables when calling the ansible playbook. Note that to enable
  this feature, one has to install the urllib_gssapi python library.
