bugfixes:
    - States ``dump`` and ``restore`` only need pg_dump and pg_restore. These tools
      don't use psycopg2 so this change tries to avoid the use of it in these
      cases. Fixes https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35906
    - Replace the fix for https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39412
      made in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39483 when using a compression
      program. This now uses a FIFO file to ensure failure detection of pg_dump.
      The Windows compatibility is completely dropped in this case.
