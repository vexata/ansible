bugfixes:
- ssh - Check the return code of the ssh process before raising AnsibleConnectionFailure, as the error message
  for the ssh process will likely contain more useful information. This will improve the missing interpreter messaging
  when using modules such as setup which have a larger payload to transfer when combined with pipelining.
