minor_changes:
- "Modules and plugins have been standardized on a well-defined set of
  TLS-related parameters.  The old names remain as aliases for compatibility.
  In general, the new names will override the old names if both are specified.
  The standard names are: ``client_cert`` (certificate for client identity,
  might also include the private key), ``client_key`` (private key for
  ``client_cert``), ``ca_cert`` (public key to validate server's identity,
  usually a root certificate), and ``validate_certs`` (boolean to enable or
  disable certificate validity checking)."
