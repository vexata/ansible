minor_changes:
  - inventory plugins - Inventory plugins that support caching can now use any cache plugin
    shipped with Ansible.
deprecated_features:
  - inventory plugins - Inventory plugins using self.cache is deprecated and will be removed
    in 2.12. Inventory plugins should use self._cache as a dictionary to store results.
  - cache plugins - Importing cache plugins directly is deprecated and will be removed in 2.12.
    Cache plugins should use the cache_loader instead so cache options can be reconciled via
    the configuration system rather than constants.
