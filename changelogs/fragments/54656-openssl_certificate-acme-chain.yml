minor_changes:
- "openssl_certificate - change default value for ``acme_chain`` from ``yes`` to ``no``. Current versions
   of `acme-tiny <https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny/>`_ do not support the ``--chain`` command anymore.
   This default setting caused the module not to work with such versions of acme-tiny until
   ``acme_chain: no`` was explicitly set."
